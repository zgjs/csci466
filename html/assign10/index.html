    <h1>CSCI 466 - Assignment 10</h1>
    <h2>MariaDB in C++ (100 pts)</h2>
    <h3>The Task</h3>
    <p>For this assignment, you will be writing a C/C++ program that prints reports on the books found in the henrybooks database from our MariaDB server.</p>
    <h3>Requirements</h3>
    <p>
        Your program will show a menu with three options for reports to show. The user will choose an option,
        and your program will use the MariaDB C API to run the necessary queries, displaying the results, neatly
        formatted, in the terminal.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Book List:</strong>
            For each book, print the title, the author(s), and the cost. Do not assume that a book will
            be written by a single author. Use a subquery to accomplish this. Sort the authors for each book based
            on their Sequence.</li>
        <li><strong>Author Search</strong>
            Prompt the user for the name of an Author. Print a report showing all books by
            authors whose first or last names match the user-supplied name. For each of the books found, show a
            line in your output with the book code, the title, the name of the author that matched your search, and
            the price; then show individual lines (indented below the original line) for each branch, each showing
            how many of the current book are on hand, or a single line indicating that it is out of stock everywhere if
            no branches have any on hand. Branches should be displayed as their names and not as their numerical
            identifiers, in alphabetical order
        </li>
        <li><strong>Title Search</strong>
            Same as the author search in feature 2, but search by title instead of by author. For the
            author field, use the first author only (by sequence number).
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        There should also be an option to quit. After performing whichever option is chosen (obviously except for
        the one to quit), your program should show the menu again and allow the user to choose a new option to run.
    </p>
    <h3>Demo</h3>
    <div style="max-width: 800px; margin: auto;">
        <script id="asciicast-5jlvby7baUoAJg6hiGhL3K8W2" src="https://asciinema.org/a/5jlvby7baUoAJg6hiGhL3K8W2.js" async></script>
    </div>
    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The grading for this will be done by compiling and running this program on turing and/or hopper. If
            your program does not compile and run properly on turing and hopper, you will not receive credit, so
            make sure to test it there
        </li>
        <li>
            If your program needs any flags other than the ones used in the examples of gcc/g++ in the slides in
            order to compile, you need to let us know when you submit.
        </li>
        <li>
            Don’t forget to document your code.
        </li>
        <li>
            It is <em>not</em> a requirement that every feature be implemented with a single query. You can break the tasks
            down into smaller queries if you find it makes solving the problem easier.
        </li>
        <li>
            As always, you should be submitting your own work. Do not try to cheat or plagiarize other people’s programs.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>What to turn in?</h3>
    <p>Submit, through Blackboard, the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your C++ source code, in a file called <code>books.cc</code></li>
        <li>Any other source code or header files your program needs in order to compile</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Schema for <code>henrybooks</code></h3>
    <p>For your convenience, I have included information on the schema of <code>henrybooks</code> below:</p>
